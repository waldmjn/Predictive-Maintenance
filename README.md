- UID: unique identifier ranging from 1 to 10000
- productID: consisting of a letter L, M, or H for low (50% of all products), medium (30%), and high (20%) as - - - product quality variants and a variant-specific serial number
- air temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process later normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K
- process temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K.
- rotational speed [rpm]: calculated from powepower of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise
- torque [Nm]: torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm with an Ïƒ = 10 Nm and no negative values.
- tool wear [min]: The quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool in the process. and a
'machine failure' label that indicates, whether the machine has failed in this particular data point for any of the following failure modes are true.
